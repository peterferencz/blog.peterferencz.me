# My setup for new Computers
This is a list of steps I go through when setting up a new freshly installed windows machine, but most of them work for other operating systems also.

# Windows stuff

### Windows debloater
Windows debloater helps you remove unnecessary applications from windows, for example onedrive and cortana. This is my must-use tool for laptops, because it can free up both memory and storage.

### Change bootup logo
You can change the logo which windows shows up when starting. You however have to change a UEFI setting, which some people don't like messing with.

If you've done that, you can also change the bios image, althoug you really shuoldn't do that if you don't know what you are doing.

### Registeries
One thing I've gotten used to over the years is that I have *open with notepad* in my right-click context menu. Here's a tutorial for it: [https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-open-with-notepad-to-the-context-menu-for-all-files/](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-open-with-notepad-to-the-context-menu-for-all-files/)

# Visuals

### Rainmeter
Rainmeter can bring any desktop to a whole new level. It has a great widget system for time, resource usage, weather, or you can even make your own. I can recommend [Monstercat Visualizer](https://github.com/marcopixel/Monstercat-Visualizer) which displays what you are listening to, and works well whith spicetify.

### Lively wallpaper
Lively wallpaper is just basically the open-source equivalent of wallpaper engine. It does the same as wallpaper engine like animated backgrounds and mouse interaction. Overall a great application.

### Spicetify
I like listening to music through spotify, but I quickly got bored with it's flat and bland looking ui. My solution was Spicetify. Because spotify was made with electron, spicetify just injects custom css and/or javascript to extend it's style or functionality. My favourite themes are Dribble and Ziro (Dark Blue scheme)

### I don't care about cookies
No, I really don't. If you are upset at popups and panels asking for your consent for using cookies, then this addon is for you. It automatically accepts these popups and as the website says: *"It saves you thousands of unnecessary clicks"*.
