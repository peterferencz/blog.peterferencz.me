# My setup for new Computers
This is a list of steps I go through when setting up a new freshly installed windows machine, but most of them work for other operating systems also.

### Windows debloater
Windows debloater helps you remove unnecessary applications from windows, for example onedrive and cortana. This is my must-use tool for laptops, because it can free up both memory and storage.

### Registeries
One thing I've gotten used to over the years is that I have *open with notepad* in my right-click context menu. Here's a tutorial for it: [https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-open-with-notepad-to-the-context-menu-for-all-files/](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-open-with-notepad-to-the-context-menu-for-all-files/)

# Visuals

### Rainmeter
Rainmeter can bring any desktop to a whole new level. It has a great widget system for time, resource usage, weather, or you can even make your own. I can recommend [Monstercat Visualizer](https://github.com/marcopixel/Monstercat-Visualizer) which displays what you are listening to, and works well whith spicetify.

### Lively wallpaper
Lively wallpaper is just basically the open-source equivalent of wallpaper engine. It does the same as wallpaper engine like animated backgrounds and mouse interaction. Overall a great application.

### Spicetify
I like listening to music through spotify, but I quickly got bored with it's flat and bland looking ui. My solution was Spicetify. Because spotify was made with electron, spicetify just injects custom css and/or javascript to extend it's style or functionality. My favourite themes are Dribble and Ziro (Dark Blue scheme)
